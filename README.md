# Kvasir-go

Welcome to this repository. This is an attempt at learning machine learning.

## The idea

The idea was to create a game that a computer could learn. This game will be simple, just a dude running around with a gun. There will be spots to "hide" from enemies. Enemies will spawn in waves and there might be pickups.

## Afterwards

I plan to make a machine learning algorithm that actually learns to play the game. Don't know exactly how yet. This section will be filled when I do know.

# Build 

```bash
go get github.com/eshumkv/kvasir-go
go run github.com/eshumkv/kvasir-go/main/kvasir-go
```

## FighterML

This is basically a rewrite of the nim project [FighterML](https://github.com/Eshumkv/MLfighter).
