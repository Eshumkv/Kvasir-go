# Kvasir-go

Welcome to this repository. This is an attempt at learning machine learning. At least, that's how it started in my head. In the current state of the project, I'm learning all kinds of things about Entity Component Systems and game development in general. This was a bigger project than I thought; I haven't even started on the machine learning aspect of it! 

## The idea

The idea was to create a game that a computer could learn. This game will be simple, just a dude running around with a gun. There will be spots to "hide" from enemies. Enemies will spawn in waves and there might be pickups.

## Afterwards

I plan to make a machine learning algorithm that actually learns to play the game. Don't know exactly how yet. This section will be filled when I do know.

# Build 

```bash
go get github.com/eshumkv/kvasir-go
go run github.com/eshumkv/kvasir-go/main/kvasir-go
```

## FighterML

This is basically a rewrite of the nim project [FighterML](https://github.com/Eshumkv/MLfighter). (DEAD PROJECT)
